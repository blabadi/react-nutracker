## bootstrap

## components:
- search box:
    - created dashboard and search
    - created repos to abstract rest calls
    - passed changes from search to dashboard
    - onChange event handler from dashboard 
    - dashboard calls stub repo
    - passes result back 
        - needed key for iteration over resutls in render
        - need some way to pass generic search results / render function for results
